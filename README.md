### Who Am I?

I'm a self-taught programmer interested in working as a programmer and wants to make a go of it!  Currently, I'm a customer success manager at a real estate company, and in the mornings and evenings I work on programming.  It's been really fun learning how to build basic programs, and I would like to one day work at a company building applications to help move society forward.
